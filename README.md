# Flutter CRUD with JSONPlaceholder API

## Description

A Flutter application that performs complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).  
It allows users to:
- View a list of users
- Add a new user
- Edit existing user details
- Delete a user with confirmation
This is a beginner-friendly project ideal for understanding API integration, local state, and UI component breakdown in Flutter.
The app uses **local state management** (`setState`) and displays user data in a clean, intuitive UI.

## Tech Stack

- Flutter	- Mobile UI framework used for building cross-platform apps
- Dart	- Programming language used in Flutter
- HTTP	- For making API requests to JSONPlaceholder
- Stateful Widgets	- To manage UI updates using setState()
- JSONPlaceholder	- A fake online REST API for testing and prototyping



##  Key Features / Use Cases

-  **Fetch & Display Users**  
  Retrieves user data from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays it in a scrollable list.

-  **Add New User**  
  Users can add new entries using a form. Newly created users appear at the top of the list.

-  **Edit User Details**  
  Users can tap the edit icon (pencil) to update existing user details with a pre-filled form.

-  **Delete User with Confirmation**  
  Each user has a delete icon. On clicking it, a confirmation dialog appears to prevent accidental deletion.

-  **Local State Management**  
  All updates (add/edit/delete) are handled using Flutterâ€™s built-in `setState` for simplicity and clarity.

-  **Form Validation**  
  Both email and name fields are validated before submission for better user input quality.

-  **Responsive UI**  
  UI is simple, minimal and works well across devices.

-  **Componentized Architecture**  
  Code is broken down into components: user list, user edit, user create, and service layer for scalability.
